## Hardware
* NodeMCU board
* DHT11

## Features
* opens an access point to enter your local Wifi SSID and password
* three customisable slots for your sockets
* custom brightness settings for the LED matrix
* Read Data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor

## Ideas for the future
* a light sensor could turn on the lights automatically
* a proper case (3D printed, wood...)
